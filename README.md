# attempts

sometimes i write things

## tech stack

**pnpm (package manager)** high speed downloads, low disk space, yaml  
**typescript** self-defense  
**react** more copy-pastable help articles online  
**astro (web framework)** reduce js, simple static website gen  
**postcss (css processor)** it came with astro  
**tailwindcss (css framework)** when i began, css was 100% magic words. so i picked opinionated magic words  
**tailwind typography** markdown  
**prettier (formatter)** i've used it before  
**husky (commit hook)** i keep forgetting to prettier format

```sh
git clone https://codeberg.org/swomf/attempts
cd attempts
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
