In 2022, [Frederick the Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=575&v=USKD3vPD6ZA) beat the [NASDAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite) by 14% and a certain (idiotic)
investment subreddit by $7k. <br />
(At market opening, he went to either the left or right of his
tank to buy some random stock.)

In 2012, [Orlando the Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Insley) beat professional investors by 7.2%. <br />
(He threw a [toy mouse](https://qz.com/47058/orlando-the-cat-has-a-better-chance-of-beating-the-stock-market-than-a-hedge-fund-manager) at a grid of stocks to communicate his superior intellect.)

In Burton Malkiel's _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_ (1973), he generalized this phenomenon (see chapter 1):

> ...a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at the stock listings could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one selected by the experts.

Wow. Other than insulting Harvard finance guys,
what does this all mean? If the pros are that bad at reliably
predicting when the arrow goes up or down, even with their
Sharpe ratios, betas, and $\sum$ equations, are us everyday
investors doomed?

{/* prettier-ignore */}
Well, no. The big guys are trying to _beat_ the market.
Matching the market is just the mediocre outcome.
It's obvious and boring to them. But for us average people,
whose understandings are clouded by all
the <a href="#Aside 1" id="To aside 1">salesmen and YOLOers</a>, understanding and sticking to this mediocrity isn't a
half-bad choice. This mediocrity is the only thing about
stocks that I was ever taught. I'll try my best to be
transparent about what I learned; hopefully it can help you.

<div class="p-1 mr-8 border-2 border-[var(--white)] rounded-lg">

As a primer, let's try matching the market together.

import MatchTheMarketIsland from "../../components/blog/mom-im-scared-of-the-stock-market/MatchTheMarket.tsx";
import marketData from "../../components/blog/mom-im-scared-of-the-stock-market/MatchTheMarket.json";

<MatchTheMarketIsland client:load marketData={marketData} />

Try out numbers like 5, 10, and 30. See what gets positive
and when?

<span class="text-xs">
  (Data source: [NYU
  Stern](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html)).{" "}
  <br />I took the [geometric
  average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean#Average_growth_rate) of
  percentages over periods of time. Inflation is factored in by simple
  subtractions ([Fisher
  equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_equation)).

</div>

So, over the long run, stocks go up. Even with the -40% in some
year, +50% in another, in the long run our worst growth isn't
even negative.

I used to think investing was scary. Searching for advice made
it spookier:

Of course, this article falls under "who even are you?", but
I do my best to be transparent with direct,
accessible citations. Perhaps an appeal to authority, but
this article is based on a talk I had with an economics instructor
(I will let their name stay private).
