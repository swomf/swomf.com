## Preface

Privacy articles follow these four formulas.

> Breach at Lawncuttr leaks 7 million credit card numbers

> WiFi-connected lawn mowers use liquid chromatography grass analysis
> to predict income levels and personalize ads

> Maximizing privacy, security, and anonymity with LawnVPN

> DeLawning isn't enough: How to scramble your grass pheromones
> with Gentoo SELinux

And readers of these articles generally come to three conclusions:

> It's fine, really. My bank app notifies me against identity fraud,
> and my email has all my passwords -- only Saudi Arabian journalists
> and stalker victims really need to care.

> We're screwed. Not much we can do, even 90% privacy and security is
> impossible anyways.

> Install Gentoo lmao. Just put in the effort, it's not that
> hard -- if you give up, think again about whether you 'care'.

Now that we've summarized 100% of all inputs and outputs (no sarcasm here~)
let's try to _slightly_ differ.

Single-minded defeatist fearmongering is easy;
technoelitist anarchic exclusionism is easy; selective,
willful ignorance is easy.

Keeping things palatable is hard.

  <summary>OK, so _what_ is this article about? (click to view)</summary>

For the lazy, here's what my article is about. Feel free to skip around.

<b>HISTORICAL CONTEXT:</b> Corporate digital surveillance capitalism since the
2000s, along with state digital surveillance as illustrated by Snowden's 2013
leak, has exacerbated over time, leading to an increased concern in online
privacy, awareness, and alleviation.

<b>INTENDED AUDIENCE</b>: Citizens, technically savvy or not, and people in
power at relevant firms, who want verifiably real, actionable, colorful
information without combing through research papers, repetitive slog, or overly
biased views.

<b>PURPOSE:</b> To provide a concise, verifiable list of issue vectors and
mitigations, including specific citations, summaries, and brief analyses.

<b>POINT OF VIEW:</b> Online privacy is a disaster, but everyone deserves
privacy, regardless of background.

## Introduction

French polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace supposed that, if you knew everything
about a physical instant, then you could calculate the entire past and future.

Though such a being -- _"Laplace's Demon"_ -- is fundamentally impossible,
the idea is very useful: if you (or a server in Dallas) knew all of that about
customers, you'd make _fat cash_. Investments? Guaranteed. Terrorists?
Predicted. Hidden criminals? Outed! The possibilities are endless.

Of course, you need to be very big and have a lot of data points. So, to become
the best predictor, the obvious Bigs -- state and corporate -- entered a race to
milk the obvious Big Data pool -- telecommunications.

And they helped each other do it.

- As early as 1970, the NSA had major radio companies supply them
  with "all incoming and outgoing US telephone calls and telegrams"
  (Finley & Esposito, 2014, p. 186).
- In the 2000s, surveillance capitalism formally skyrocketed; "Other search
  engines had the chance... \[it\] was Google that recognized the gold dust in
  the detritus of its interactions with its users" -- the "data exhaust" of
  searchers recycled into recursive learning (Zuboff, 2019, Part 1 Section 3).
- In 2013, Snowden revealed the depth of NSA's incredible
  warrantless spy campaign on its country's own citizens. It was so famous that
  John Oliver did a [comedy sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEVlyP4_11M)
  on it.

Okay... so they CAN get this. Sure, why not. But what will they even do with it?
Just ad stuff, criminal-catching, and the occasional mistake, right?
Well... let's think aloud.

- (U.S.) The opposite party comes into power, and renders something you're
  doing as completely illegal.
- The data describes an incorrect or _extremely_ correct version of you.
  Your social credit score/financial credit score is put at risk.
- Humor changes. A joke you enjoyed in a prior decade is no longer acceptable
  for employers.
- You are from a disadvantaged neighborhood. Due to an issue, your grades are
  reduced by an algorithmic grade predictor.
- Your Amazon Echo records extremely private information after randomly
  turning on, and an offsite listener verifies that the speech-to-text matches
  the speech.

Unfortunately, because Laplace's Demon is so deadbeat, all of these already
happened.

1. Abortion or certain forms of gun ownership
2. Creditworthiness
3. Cancellation, perhaps by employers
4. Ofqual (UK)
5. Amazon

So what can we do?
