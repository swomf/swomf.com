French polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace supposed that, if you knew everything
about a physical instant, then you could calculate the entire past and future.

Though such a being -- _"Laplace's Demon"_ -- is fundamentally impossible,
the idea is very useful: if you (or a server in Dallas) knew all of that about
customers, you'd make _fat cash_. Investments? Guaranteed. Terrorists?
Predicted. Hidden criminals? Outed! The possibilities are endless.

Of course, you need to be very big, on the level of state and corporate, and
have a lot of data points, on the level of telecommunications...

Yeah, they've been doing it for fifty years.

- 1970: the NSA has major radio companies supply them
  with "all incoming and outgoing US telephone calls and telegrams"
  (Finley & Esposito, 2014, p. 186).
- 2000s: Google becomes the vanguard of surveillance capitalism.
  "...\[it\] was Google that recognized the gold dust in the detritus of its
  interactions with its users... \[the\] data exhaust" recycled into
  recursive learning (Zuboff, 2019, Part 1 Section 3).
- 2013: Snowden blows the whistle on the NSA's incredibly deep,
  warrantless spy campaign on its country's own citizens, in a move so famous
  that John Oliver did a [comedy sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEVlyP4_11M)
  on it.

...so what?

This is just another privacy article, isn't it? Privacy articles are _so predictable_:

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 *:p-2 *:border-2 *:border-[var(--white)] *:rounded-lg *:*:m-0">
  <div>Breach at Lawncut Co. leaks 7 million credit card numbers</div>

and only three perspectives exist:

  <div class="row-span-2">
    It's fine, really. My bank app notifies me against identity fraud, and my
    email has all my passwords -- only Saudi Arabian journalists and stalker
    victims really need to care.
    <br />
    I'm pretty much safe!
  </div>
  <div>
    We're screwed. Not much we can do, even 90% privacy and security is
    impossible anyways.
  </div>
  <div>
    Install Linux lmao. If you aren't even patient enough to set up Arkenfox
    then think again about whether you 'care'.
  </div>

All this data is just... harmless ad stuff, or criminal/dissenter-catching, and
the occasional mistake -- it doesn't matter to me! It's all nebulous tech
weirdo-ing. No one's _personally_ breaching my privacy, well, some big algorithm
might be, but this _simply does not matter to the average Joe_.

Let me ask a question.

What kind of situation would it matter in?

Let's think aloud.

1. (U.S.) The opposite party comes into power, and renders something you're
   doing as completely illegal. You worry about what you say or do.
   - Eh. I'm an upstanding citizen!
2. The data describes an incorrect or _extremely_ correct version of you.
   Your social credit score/financial credit score is put at risk.
   - Eh. I'm not in China!
3. Humor changes. A joke you enjoyed in a prior decade is no longer acceptable
   for employers.
   - Eh, I keep my Facebook friends-only!
4. You are from a disadvantaged neighborhood. Due to an issue, your grades are
   reduced by an algorithmic grade predictor.
   - Eh. Couldn't possibly happen. Even if it did, it'd be fixed quickly!
5. Your Amazon Echo records extremely... _private_ information after randomly
   turning on, and an outsourced listener verifies that the speech-to-text matches
   the speech.
   - Eh, they'd get sued anyway. Plus, Amazon Music is convenient!

Laplace's Demon is deadbeat.

In the US/UK, _all of that has happened_.

## The purpose of this article

Feel free to skip around, but below, I discuss the following:

1. Privacy threats <a href="#threat-vectors">(skip to)</a> that have or are occurring, with sources. (Boring, but
   might be useful.) - Some of these sources are scholarly or in book form. <br />
   I really hope you
   don't accidentally go to sites like Sci-Hub for free scholarly sources, or
   sites like Anna's Archive or Library Genesis for free books,
   because those sites are very safe and distribute knowledge; it's something
   we don't want. Right mates?
2. Methods of response. <a href="#what-do-i-do-now">(skip to)</a>
   - This includes individuals, regardless of tech-savviness, and firms.

Keeping things palatable is hard. I'll do my best to avoid fearmongering,
defeatism, and absolutes. However, that means that some may respond with
"They deserved that!" for differing privacy incidents listed under "All Oopsies".

  <summary>Note for students (click to view)</summary>

<b>HISTORICAL CONTEXT:</b> Corporate digital surveillance capitalism since the
2000s, along with state digital surveillance as illustrated by Snowden's 2013
leak, has exacerbated over time, leading to an increased concern in online
privacy, awareness, and alleviation.

<b>INTENDED AUDIENCE</b>: Citizens, technically savvy or not, and people in
power at relevant firms, who want verifiably real, actionable, colorful
information without combing through research papers, repetitive slog, or overly
biased views.

<b>PURPOSE:</b> To provide a concise, verifiable list of issue vectors and
mitigations, including specific citations, summaries, and brief analyses.

<b>POINT OF VIEW:</b> Online privacy is a disaster, but everyone deserves
privacy, regardless of background.

## Threat vectors

- According to [Anselmi et al.](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.06203v1) ([pdf ver.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06203)), in a traffic analysis of Samsung and LG smart televisions, Automatic Content Recognition (ACR), second-party tracking "conducted directly by the smart TV platform via its operating system", "periodically captures frames (and/or audio), builds a fingerprint of the content, and then shares it... \[to match\] it against a database of known content", for the use of "personalized ads". "LG likely batches frames capured every 10 ms" and "Samsung... captures the frames every 500ms". Users of Samsung and LGTV must disable [6 to 11 options](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.06203v1#A0.T1).
  - "Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) (Peterson, 2022) is widely used for second-party tracking in smart TVs. As shown in Figure 1, ACR periodically captures frames (and/or audio), builds a fingerprint of the content, and then shares it with an ACR server for matching it against a database of known content (e.g., movies, ads, live feed). When the fingerprint matches, ACR server can determine exactly what piece of content is being watched on the smart TV. This enables smart TV platforms like Samsung and LG to profile users into audience segments (Center, 2024; LG, 2022), which are then used to target personalized ads. Fingerprints in ACR are essentially hash of the content, which can be matched at the server-side to identify the content. However, the fact that the hash of content rather than raw content is sent to ACR servers does not necessarily make the data “anonymous” (Staff in the Office of Technology, 2024). Moreover, the viewing habits of a user is potentially identifying (Narayanan and Shmatikov, 2008)."
